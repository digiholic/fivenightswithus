========================================== CHANGELOG ==========================================

v0.6 - Primary focus: readability and user experience:
  * Improved GUI, mainly status bars. Bars now have outlines and text.
  * Energy Generation Cap when tension is low increased to 40 (up from 20)
    Base Energy Generation when tension is low decreased to 0.5 (down from 1.0)
  * Energy and Tension adjustments are now made before graphics are updated, not after.
    This means you will no longer see a bar bigger than it should be for a frame before the graphics "catch up"
  * Cleared up the wording on default Move option's tooltip (Now states it's random nature, instead of just "without regard to tactics"
  * Tactical Move is now unselectable until Tension is above 50%.
    This change is meant to remove information the player doesn't need at the start, as well as draw their attention to it when they have enough energy.
    End result should be players are more likely to use Tactical Moves in the late game, when Tension is high and Energy is abundant.
